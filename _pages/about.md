## Hello!

I am a spacesuit biomechanics researcher interested in the intersection of fit and performance, as it relates to humans on the ground and as they go into space. I love to explore how computer vision techniques and sensor technology can be used to assess the relationship between fit and performance. In addition, I am also interested in how we can use alternative reality technologies, such as augmented- and virtual-reality, for spacecraft habitat design and mission training. 

I am currently a PhD student in the [bioastronautics research group](https://www.colorado.edu/bioastronautics/), advised by Dr. Allison Anderson under the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. My thesis focuses on developing a framework to improve the fit and mobility of spacesuits by utilizing dynamic body-shape modeling. I am specifically focusing on developing extra-vehicular activity boots with improved dynamic fit through the gait cycle by implementing [dynamic foot-shape modeling](https://anderson-cu-bioastronautics.github.io/dynamic_foot_shape_model_viewer/).

In my free time, I enjoy watching Formula 1, riding my motorcycle, racing virtually, enjoying a hike, or cooking a new meal.
