# Work experience
* Graduate Research Assistant - University of Colorado Boulder Bioastronautics Research Group (2017-present)
  * Thesis: **Dynamic Foot Shape Models to Improve Spacesuit Boot Fit**
    * Developed in-house 4D scanning setup to model dynamic foot morphology and creating framework to utilize dynamic foot morphology modeling in designing planetary spacesuit boots with better fit, comfort, and mobility
    * [Predictively modeled foot shape deformation](https://anderson-cu-bioastronautics.github.io/dynamic_foot_shape_model_viewer/) during stance phase with accuracy of 5.2mm from 30 subjects
  * Other projects include:
    * **Quantifying Injury Risk in Spacesuits Using Contact Pressure Sensors**: Developed sensor architecture to quantify contact pressure magnitude and distribution between human and spacesuit
    * **Evaluation of XR Technologies for Spacecraft Habitat Design**: Developed experimental methodology and technology required to compare the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and hybrid reality against physical reality mockups in the design of spacecraft habitats.
  * *funded through National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and CU Boulder Smead Scholars Program*

* Technical Consultant - Volumental AB (2020-present)
  * **Characterization of heel- and ball-width across global foot population**: Developed new metric to measure how width varies across foot length. Analyzed across large (>1 million) global foot scan database to provide insights for last grading

* Engineering Assistant - Zin Technologies (2016-2017)
  * **Integration of Finite-Element Modeling into a Bone Remodeling Model**: Investigated bone remodeling during microgravity exercise loads by developing CT-scan based finite element models; defining loads based on ISS exercise and deriving material properties from scans. Worked in conjunction with NASA Glenn Research Center.

* Biomedical Engineering Intern - NASA Johnson Space Center Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (2016)
  * **Exploring Use of 3dMD Photogrammetric Scanner for Anthropometric Measurements**: Developed Python interface to automatically recognize anthropometric landmarks using image processing techniques. Validated use of body scanner against laser scanner for astronaut suit sizing protocols and body shape modeling projects
  * **A Parametric Model of Shoulder Articulation for Virtual Assessment of Spacesuit Fit**: Developed Python tools to automatically process 3D scan data and model deformation from shoulder articulation
  * **Validation of Pressure-Sensitive Mats for Use in Spacesuit Shoulder Injury Studies**: Led testing to characterize use of mats to detect peak contact pressure during isolated shoulder movements in spacesuit.
  * **Validation of Fabric Strain Sensors for the Evaluation of Lumbar Motion: Pilot Study**: Defined procedures for wireless data collection and syncing of multiple instruments
